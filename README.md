# hello-world
Just figuring things out. 

Hello! agentx999 here. I'm really not an agent at all, just an ordinary curious person who wants to know how Git works. It seems pretty interesting as of now, but also a little confusing. 9 is my second-favorite number, by the way. I didn't want to name myself agentx000; it just looked too odd.
